### Version History ###

```
0.6.0 - Updated VSS SDK to M104
0.1.1 - Automatically increase extension's minor version when packaging.
```

### Usage ###

1. Clone the repository
1. `npm install` to install required local dependencies
2. `npm install -g grunt` to install a global copy of grunt (unless it's already installed)
2. `grunt` to build and package the application

#### Grunt ####

Three basic `grunt` tasks are defined:

* `build` - Compiles TS files in `scripts` folder
* `package-dev` - Builds the development version of the vsix package
* `package-release` - Builds the release version of the vsix package
* `publish-dev` - Publishes the development version of the extension to the marketplace using `tfx-cli`
* `publish-release` - Publishes the release version of the extension to the marketplace using `tfx-cli`

Note: To avoid `tfx` prompting for your token when publishing, login in beforehand using `tfx login` and the service uri of ` https://marketplace.visualstudio.com`.

#### Including framework modules ####

The VSTS framework is setup to initalize the requirejs AMD loader, so just use `import Foo = require("foo")` to include framework modules.

#### VS Code ####

The included `.vscode` config allows you to open and build the project using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### Unit Testing ####

The project is setup for unit testing using `mocha`, `chai`, and the `karma` test runner. A simple example unit test is included in `scripts/logic/messageHelper.tests.ts`. To run tests just execute:

```
grunt test
```
